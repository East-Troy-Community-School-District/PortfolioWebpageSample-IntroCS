        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            For our second project, I had to create a portfolio website, which
            you are currently on! In order to create this website, I had to learn
            about HTML and CSS. HTML provides the structure and content to the 
            website, while CSS adds the style. For each project we complete in 
            the class, I will add a new page to the website. In addition, the website
            will be hosted using GitHub Pages so that it is accessible over the
            internet.
        </p>

        <h2>End Result of Project</h2>
        <p>Here is the semi-finished website...</p>
        <iframe src="index.html" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
        <p>
            By completing this project, I learned about HTMl and CSS. While I don't know
            everything (there is a LOT), I have a start on some of the fundamentals.
        </p>
        <h3>What went well?</h3>
        <p>
            I think it is so cool that I can access my website over the internet.
        </p>
        <h3>What could have gone better?</h3>
        <p>
            Because of my limited knowledge of CSS, I did not know how to make my website
            look more modern. In the future, I would like to revisit my website to make
            it look cooler.
