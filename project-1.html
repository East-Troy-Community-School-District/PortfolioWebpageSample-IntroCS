        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            For our first project, I was tasked to research PC parts to build my own computer.
            First, I had to identify how I was going to use the computer. In my case, I planned
            to <marK>write programs</marK>, <marK>design models using CAD</marK>, and <marK>play 
            videogames</marK> with this computer. After identifying my needs, I decided to research 
            individual parts to custom build my PC. This research can be found in the Google Doc 
            below! Finally, I created a one-pager about the PC I created.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
        <p>
            By completing this project, I learned how to research PC parts and check for
            compatability. As an added bonus, I also learned how to use Canva to create
            posters.
        </p>
        <h3>What went well?</h3>
        <p>
            I think the poster turned out awesome! In addition, I was able to convince
            my wife to let me purchase the PC parts and build the computer, which has
            been working great.
        </p>
        <h3>What could have gone better?</h3>
        <p>
            Because the graphics card I selected supports high resolutions than the monitors
            I have support, I will need to purchase new monitors. I did not factor this in
            to the original budget, so it will be an additional cost at a later date!
